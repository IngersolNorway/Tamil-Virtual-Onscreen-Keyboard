Dear GitHub Community,

I'm excited to introduce the Tamil Virtual Onscreen Keyboard - விசைப்பலகை for computers. This onscreen typing tool is designed for touch screens and functions similarly to the Google Indic Tamil keyboard for Android. I hope this keyboard proves useful to all users.

Key Features:

- Supports both க layout and க் layout.
- Option to switch between horizontal and vertical keyboard layouts.
- Available in three sizes: 1x, 2x, and 3x.

We believe this contribution will greatly benefit the Tamil typing community. Thank you for your attention and consideration. Should you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Ingersol
